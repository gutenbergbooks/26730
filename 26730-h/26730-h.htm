<p class="c smcap top15">to<br />
my friend that great artist<br />
FERRUCCIO BUSONI</p>



<p class="c top15">NOTE</p>

<p>The very affecting history of the cruel Princess
Turandot and the handsome Prince Calaf may be
read in those Persian tales which are known by the
name of <i>The Thousand and One Nights.</i></p>

<p>Twice already has the story gone over the boards:
in 1762 in Venice as "Turandotte," one of the <i>fiabe</i> of
Count Carlo Gozzi; in 1804 in Weimar, as Friedrich
Schiller's "Turandot." Both versions lived their
passing hour, and died to the stage.</p>

<p>The present dramatisation of the ancient fable&mdash;a
modest attempt to cast good metal anew&mdash;closely
follows the Italian of the sardonic nobleman whose
bones have been mouldering by the blue lagoons for
over a hundred years.</p>

<p class="c"><i>One of the city gates of Pekin. Over the gate,

<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
(<i>Stepping in front of the footlights.</i>)<br />
<br />
My name is Pantalone, and I am a native of Venice. At<br />
the moment I am the Prime Minister of the<br />
Chinese Empire. Eh, what d'ye say? What<br />
I'<i>m</i> doing here in Pekin? H'm. (<i>Puts his hand<br />
in front of his mouth.</i>) Venice got too hot for<br />
me. An ind-indelicate affair. My wife of<br />
course, you guess my meaning. (<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">PRINCE</span>.)<br />
This, your Royal Highness, is the place you<br />
have heard so much of. Have a good look at<br />
it, <i>please</i>. Make yourself <i>quite</i> at home. Yes,<br />
quite right, up there, <i>please</i>! (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">TARTAGLIA</span>.)<br />
<br />
I say, my dear Lord Chancellor. Be so good as<br />
to show his Royal Highness the elevated position<br />
he will occupy in the near future. You have the<br />
information, I presume.<br />
<br />
(<span class="smcap">TARTAGLIA</span> <i>turns towards the</i> <span class="smcap">PRINCE</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">PANTALONE</span> <i>pulls his sleeve</i>.)<br />
<br />
Don't forget, my dear Lord Chancellor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TARTAGLIA.</span><br />
<br />
(<i>Stepping in front of the footlights.</i>) My name<br />
is Tat-Tra-Tartaglia (<i>stammers</i>). From Naples.<br />
My mother always maintained that she was the<br />
daughter of a Spanish grandee, but I fear she<br />
was a fisherman's daughter from Po-Po-Pozzuoli.<br />
My father, on the other hand (<i>stops short and<br />
looks round</i>)&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
(<span class="smcap">PANTALONE</span> <i>makes signs to him</i>.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
Better not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TARTAGLIA.</span><br />
<br />
Better not! That old scarecrow there makes<br />
out that nobody ever knew who my father was.<br />
He is a... li-li-liar. Excuse me, one moment,<br />
ladies and gentlemen. (<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Prince</span>.) That<br />
head up there on the right, which I beg your<br />
Royal Highness graciously to observe, is the head<br />
of the valiant Prince of Hyrcania. A valiant<br />
prince, a sweet prince. But silly, silly. There's<br />
quite a nice open space next to him for you, a<br />
fine, sunny situation with a pleasant prospect.<br />
How would that do, eh? Company to your liking?<br />
All of 'em in the Almanach de Gotha.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
(<i>To</i> BRIGELLA.) Send the executioner up with<br />
the pole. We'll let this charming young Prince<br />
select his own point of vantage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BRIGELLA.</span><br />
<br />
(<i>To the headsman.</i>) What are you hanging<br />
about here for, you hangman, you? Up on the<br />
wall with you, by Hikey Mo! Up on the wall or<br />
I'll wallop you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
Halt! 'Sh! Don't forget!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BRIGELLA.</span><br />
<br />
(<i>Stepping in front of the footlights.</i>) I'm<br />
Brigella, begging your pardon. One of the old<br />
honest family of the Brigellas. As you can hear<br />
by the way I talk, I was born in Ferrara. There<br />
are lying rogues, drat 'em, as say as how you can<br />
tell any one that comes from Ferrara by his<br />
knavish face. Concerning my own person, though<br />
I says it as shouldn't, I've a heart of gold. Not<br />
half. Talking about gold now, you'll be wondering,<br />
sure enough, what brought <i>me</i> from Ferrara<br />
to Pekin. Well, now, it was a purse of gold,<br />
God bless ye! It was a little matter of two<br />
hundred florins that belonged to my employer,<br />
the celebrated Dr. Gratiano...<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
(<i>Pulls his sleeve.</i>) Better not!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BRIGELLA.</span><br />
<br />
And now with this heart of gold of mine blest<br />
if I ain't got to conduct this broth of a boy,<br />
bless his honest face! to the block, by command<br />
of my mistress, the high and mighty Turandot<br />
...the cru'l Turandot. (<i>Sobs.</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TRUFFALDINO.</span><br />
<br />
(<i>Pushing</i> BRIGELLA <i>aside.</i>) That's enough.<br />
Get out of that. A regular rogue. Standing<br />
there and talking about florins.... H'm!<br />
Regular rogue.<br />
<br />
(PANTALONE <i>pulls his sleeve</i>.)<br />
<br />
Ah! quite so. I am Truffaldino, by your leave.<br />
Truffaldino from the Giudeccao Quite so.<br />
(<i>Turning towards</i> BRIGELLA.) Regular rogue.<br />
It is monstrous that the dirtiest rascals should<br />
always get on best. I have not myself always<br />
had the best of luck in these parts... Would you<br />
believe it, my voice used to be a very fine, deep<br />
baritone. But now... (<i>Sings falsetto</i>):<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am not young; I am not old;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I live, yet have no life!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ask him who hath suffered woes untold</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From some volcanic strife</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of passionate years, if he remember,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tombed in the grave of life's December,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its vanished golden June.</span><br />
<br />
What do you say about my voice? Lady-like?<br />
Well, yes, you see I've spent so much of my<br />
time in the society of ladies that I'm afraid my<br />
voice has assimilated the quality of theirs. (<i>Sighs<br />
deeply.</i>) Oh, yes. Not that there is any lack of<br />
good nourishment. Oh, no. Nor of liquid<br />
refreshment. Oh, no. Nor of refined and entertaining<br />
company. Oh, no. Nor could any one<br />
suggest that I am not in high favour. Oh, no.<br />
I have been appointed Chief... Inspector...<br />
Oh, no, no, Chief... Manager... Oh, no, no,<br />
no... Chief Administrator... Quite so!<br />
Chief Administrator of the Harem of her Imperial<br />
Highness the Princess Turandot. A position of<br />
distinction, a&mdash;<br />
<br />
(PANTALONE <i>pulls his sleeve, and drags him away</i>.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
Confound you, sir!... (<i>To the hangman, who<br />
has appeared on the wall.</i>) Another inch or so<br />
to the right. Halt! a fine place that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TARTAGLIA.</span><br />
<br />
Too far to the right, my dear colleague. Much<br />
too far to the right. There's a fine place quite<br />
near there between the young Maharajah of Timbuctoo<br />
and the Crown Prince of Beluchistan. (<i>To<br />
the headsman.</i>) Just a shade farther&mdash;to the<br />
left, that's it, you've got it&mdash;straight up, straight<br />
up. Halt!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
That will never do, my dear Lord Chancellor.<br />
That will never do. Really, we <i>can't</i> have three<br />
moustaches together. Back to the right&mdash;to the<br />
right. The Prince of Hyrcania is clean-shaven.<br />
His Royal Highness, the dear fellow, will have<br />
quite a martial appearance next to him. That's<br />
it, right in the middle. A little bit more to<br />
the front. Right you are. Halt! (<i>To the<br />
Prince.</i>) I do hope your Royal Highness is<br />
delighted with the situation we have been at such<br />
pains to select for you. Commanding position,<br />
don't you think? Eh? Very well, then, that's<br />
all right. Drive it in fast. Down with you.<br />
Quick&mdash;march! And now, your Royal Highness,<br />
my dear old fellow, may we request the honour of<br />
your company back to town? We shall proceed,<br />
according to instructions, past the harem of our<br />
illustrious Princess to the place of execution.<br />
But you won't need to make-a, long stay <i>there</i>,<br />
you'll be back here again very shortly. Let me<br />
take this opportunity of introducing to you one<br />
of our most capable, one of our busiest officials,<br />
with whom you will soon come into closer contact.<br />
A very charming man&mdash;(<i>whispers to him</i>). You'll<br />
find him sharp though, he has a cutting manner.<br />
...But don't look so cut up, your Royal Highness;<br />
keep your pecker up. Come now, love<br />
hasn't treated you so badly after all; it brings<br />
most men to the altar and then to the halter&mdash;<br />
you'll keep your head out of that noose anyhow.<br />
And your flame, your idolized, lovely Turandot,<br />
will perhaps do you the honour of appearing on<br />
the grated balcony. I tell you this in case you<br />
should by any chance desire to cast her one of<br />
your languishing glances, your Royal Highness,<br />
my dear old chappie. You silly fool you...<br />
Forward, march!... Forward, I tell you,<br />
march, and be damned to you! Right about<br />
turn, forward march!<br />

<p class="c">CALAF.</p>

<p>(<i>Stepping in front of the footlights.</i>) I am
Prince Calaf, 'sh! Nobody must know my name.
Calaf&mdash;I don't mind telling <i>you</i>. My father is
Timur, once the mighty King of Astrakhan&mdash;the
cruel Sultan of Taschkent drove us out of our own
country. O miserable fate! O heavenly gods!
I wandered for months and months with my
parents in the desert. Our foe, the Sultan, sent
riders after us. At the Court of Kaikobad, King
of the Carcasenes, I served as a gardener. His
daughter, the Princess Adelma, fell in love with
me. I had to flee again, and came to Berlas.
There I kept my poor parents by carrying burdens,
and by begging. Then a happy chance gave
me these fine clothes, a horse, and this purse of
gold. I set out in quest of adventure. And
here I am now in Pekin.</p>

<br />
When your ill-fated army fought and lost<br />
Before the gates of Astrakhan, and fled<br />
Close followed by the Sultan of Taschkent,<br />
Who, barbarous, o'er the battlefield careered,<br />
I in my helpless rage and wounded sore<br />
Sought refuge in the city. There I heard<br />
Timur, your noble father, like yourself,<br />
Had fallen in the battle. Weeping then,<br />
I hastened to the Palace, with intent<br />
To save Elmase, your mother, from the foe.<br />
I could not find her. And already raged<br />
The Sultan o'er the unresisting town.<br />
I turned my back on hope, and fled away.<br />
And after months of wandering I came hither,<br />
And took a false name, calling myself Hassan<br />
The Persian, and as such I came to know<br />
A widow in distress. By virtue of<br />
My few remaining jewels which I sold<br />
For her, and by the good advice I gave,<br />
I rescued her from utter penury.<br />
She was not thankless, I disliked her not,<br />
And in the end I married her. And she<br />
Even to this very day thinks that I am<br />
A Persian, and she calls me Hassan, not<br />
Barak. And so I live with her, and I<br />
Am poor indeed after my former state,<br />
But richer than a prince now that I find<br />
You who are dearer to me than a son,<br />
Now that I find my Prince Calaf alive.<br />

<br />
'Sh! Speak no name! On that disastrous day<br />
I hied me with my father to the Palace.<br />
We snatched what precious things we could, and fled,<br />
We and my mother, out of Astrakhan,<br />
All three in beggars' garb.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK</span> (<i>weeps</i>).<br />
<br />
Prince, say no more!<br />
My heart is breaking. Timur, my noble King,<br />
The Queen herself in such sad lowliness.<br />
But are they yet alive?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
They are alive,<br />
Barak. They both are living. And after that,<br />
Wandering still farther, in the end we came<br />
Unto the city of the Carcasenes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK</span> (<i>rises</i>).<br />
<br />
O say no more! I have heard enough of grief...<br />
And yet I see you as a knight attired.<br />
Tell me how fortune favoured you at last.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Tell you how fortune&mdash;<i>favoured</i> me? You jest!<br />
But I will tell you how I fared. The Khan<br />
Of Berlas hath a favourite sparrow-hawk,<br />
That with his jesses to the forest flew.<br />
By some good chance I caught this hawk, and brought him<br />
Home to the Khan, who questioned of my name.<br />
I hid my birth, and painted myself poor,<br />
A porter of burdens, and my parents ill.<br />
Straightway he sends them to the hospital... (<i>Weeps.</i>)<br />
Barak, thy King, thy Queen, in a hospital!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
Merciful God!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
To me he gives this purse here;<br />
A horse he gives me, too, and this attire.<br />
I throw myself into my parents' arms,<br />
And weeping say: "I will no longer bear<br />
To see you so. Now I will fare in quest<br />
Of the jade Fortune, and either I will lose<br />
My life, or you shall hear from me anon."<br />
They clung around my, neck, would come with me.<br />
(God grant they have not followed at my heels<br />
In their blind love!) Now to Pekin I come<br />
Where in the Emperor's army I will 'list;<br />
And if I rise!&mdash;The day of vengeance dawns!&mdash;<br />
Why is the city full to overflowing?<br />
Stay! I will seek thee out again, Barak;<br />
But now I burn to see what festival<br />
Swells such a crowd.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
O go not, my dear Prince.<br />
And spare your eyes the pitiable sight<br />
Of most ignoble butchery.<br />
<br />

Butchery?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
It cannot be but you have heard the fame<br />
Of Turandot, the Emperor's only daughter,<br />
Who, beautiful as she is cruel, fills<br />
Pekin with death and mourning without end?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Something I heard of this kind at the Court<br />
Of Kaikobad. Indeed, they told me there<br />
That Kaikobad's own son mysteriously<br />
In Pekin found his death. And this was why<br />
King Kaikobad waged war against Altoum.<br />
But these are tales told for an idle hour.<br />
Well, what comes next?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
What next? Why, Turandot,<br />
The mighty Emperor's daughter, unexcelled<br />
In the mind's keenness, and of beauty such<br />
That never master's pencil limned her (spite<br />
Of the innumerable pictures of her<br />
Which travel round the world), is so conceited,<br />
And hates all men with such a ruthless hate,<br />
The greatest princes woo her hand in vain.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
That ancient fable. And what follows next?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
This fable is a fable that is true.<br />
Her father often sought to have her wed&mdash;<br />
For she is sole heir to his mighty throne&mdash;<br />
But she said "no" to every prince that came,<br />
And his soft heart would not constrain her "yea."<br />
Not seldom her refusal led to war,<br />
And, though his arms were yet victorious,<br />
He felt the approach of age, and so one day<br />
He spake to her, deliberately resolved:<br />
"Make up thy mind to take a husband now,<br />
Or else show me a means to spare my land<br />
The throes of war. Age bows my shoulders down,<br />
And I have made too many kings my foes<br />
By breaking faith with them for love of thee.<br />
So once again I charge thee, promptly wed,<br />
Or show the means I seek, then live and die<br />
Even as it pleases thee." The proud maid then<br />
Used every artifice to thwart his will,<br />
Was sick with fury, yea, was nigh to death!<br />
And when the Emperor would not bate a jot,<br />
Hark what this wild she-devil then devised....<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
I know the tale! She craves an edict: this&mdash;<br />
That any prince be free to sue for her.<br />
With this condition: She will set the suitor<br />
Three riddles, and before the whole Divan.<br />
If he can solve them, he shall be her consort,<br />
And heir of China. If he cannot solve them,<br />
Altoum by most solemn oath is bound<br />
To rid the reckless suitor of the head<br />
Which could not solve the riddles of his daughter.<br />
Goes not the fable so? Well, you go on with it;<br />
It bores me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
Fable! Would to Heaven it were!<br />
The Emperor would not hear of it at first;<br />
But she with threats and feints and flattering<br />
Forces the old man's gentle heart to yield,<br />
Convincing him by saying: "No one ever<br />
Will risk his head on it; and if he should,<br />
In any case the Emperor would be blameless,<br />
Since it were question of an edict sworn,<br />
And noised abroad." And what she willed was done.<br />
A fable, is it? Is it a fable, all<br />
That this inhuman law has brought to pass?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Well, if you say it is so, I will credit<br />
The edict. But I never will believe<br />
That any fool has known, and risked his head.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
You won't believe it? Pray you, look up here!<br />
<br />
(<i>Points to the heads on the wall.</i>)<br />
<br />
All those are heads of hopeful princes, who<br />
Have tried their luck and could not solve the riddles,<br />
And hence... are where they are.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF (<i>horror-struck</i>).</span><br />
<br />
Most horrible!<br />
But, tell me, who could ever be so mad,<br />
So crazy, as to risk his head to win<br />
A monster of a maiden such as this?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />

Prince, he who sees her picture is so lost,<br />
That to possess the living picture he<br />

<br />
Yes, and a wise man, too.<br />
Hark to the people pouring out to see<br />
The wise and handsome Prince of Samarkand<br />
Beheaded now. The Emperor himself weeps,<br />
But the she-devil puffs herself with pride.<br />
<br />
(<i>In the distance a beating of muffled drums.</i>)<br />
<br />
This muffled rolling is the headsman's sign.<br />
It was to see it not I left the town.<br />

<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
These are strange things you tell me, Barak<br />
How<br />
Could Nature ever fashion such a thing,<br />
And call it woman, as this Turandot,<br />
So harnessed against love, so pitiless?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
My own wife's daughter serves her in the harem,<br />
And tells such things about her&mdash;things, my<br />

Worse than a tigress is this Turandot;<br />
And worst of all her vices is her pride.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />

Calm? I be calm? Like arrows stinging sharp<br />
The last words that he spoke stick in my breast:<br />
<br />
"Weep not," he said, "for I am glad to die,<br />
Since I may not possess her. Bear my greeting<br />
Unto my father. May he pardon me<br />
That when I fared I took no leave of him.<br />
Tell him it was for fear lest his denial<br />
Should force my disobedience. And show him<br />
This picture.<br />
<br />
(<i>Draws a picture from the folds of his robe.</i>)<br />
<br />
When he sees such loveliness,<br />
He will forgive, and weep my fate with thee."<br />
Thus speaking, my dear Prince a hundred times<br />
Kissed the accursed picture, and then bowed<br />
His neck to the stroke. Blood spurts on high.<br />
The trunk<br />
Quivers, and falls. High in the headsman's hands<br />
The head I love. Blind, dazed with pain I flee....<br />
<br />
(<i>Hurls the picture to the ground and tramples on it.</i>)<br />
<br />
Thou devilish, accursed witchery!<br />
I tread thee in the dust, thou spawn of Hell!<br />
And O that I could trample with these feet<br />
The witch herself! Haha! I was to take thee<br />

I've always got the blues in Pekin. Not half!<br />
Here's the Emperor just gone and issued a fresh<br />

No, it's getting a bit too hot, all our young<br />

<br />
How long, ye faithful, shall this torture last?<br />
Scarcely have we with seeming reverence<br />
Mourned the poor Prince of Samarkand, mine eyes<br />
Have scarcely dried their tears, but a new victim,<br />
New sorrow comes. O cruel daughter, born<br />
To be a curse to me! But what avails<br />
To curse the day when by the highest God<br />
I swore that edict! For I cannot break<br />
My oath; I cannot touch my daughter's heart;<br />
I cannot frighten those who come to woo.<br />
Which man of you can tell me what to do?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
My dearest Majesty, some other Counsellor<br />
must advise you in this case. In my home in<br />
Venice, Heaven knows, I never heard of such<br />
laws. In my home there are never any edicts<br />
of that sort. In my home princes don't fall in<br />
love with a medallion, and then, out of sheer<br />
love for the original, go hawking their heads about.<br />
In my home in Venice there never was a girl<br />
who refused a man when he offered, like this<br />
Princess Turandot here. Heaven knows, in my<br />
home such things don't happen even in dreams!<br />
Before I had the ill-luck to have to run away<br />
from Venice, and before I had the unmerited good<br />
fortune to be appointed your Majesty's Prime<br />
Minister, I had never heard anything about China,<br />
except that you had to be careful not to smash<br />
it; and Heaven knows it kind of knocks me<br />
on the head that in this part of the world there<br />
should be such obsolete customs and such obsolete<br />
oaths and such obsolete males and females as<br />
there are here in your country, Heaven knows.<br />
And if I were to tell the story in my home in<br />
Venice, they would say: "Shut up, you bounder!<br />
Tell that to the marines!" They'd laugh in<br />
my face, I tell you, Heaven knows!<br />
<br />
(<i>Goes to his place.</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALTOUM.</span><br />
<br />
(<i>To</i> TARTAGLIA.) Have you already seen the<br />
new arrival?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TARTAGLIA.</span><br />
<br />
I have, your Majesty. We have given him<br />
the suite reserved for foreign princes. He has<br />
a remarkably good presence, a nice face, charming<br />
manners, and a good accent. I never saw a nicer<br />
prince in all my life. I am positively in love<br />
with him, and my heart goes pit-a-pat when I<br />
think that he is at this moment on his way to<br />
have his head chopped off, just like a silly sheep;<br />
such a handsome prince, such a charming prince,<br />
such a boy of a prince....<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALTOUM.</span><br />
<br />
O sorrow!<br />
<br />
(<i>To</i> PANTALONE.) Are the sacrifices made<br />
By which we send up prayers to Providence<br />
To teach this most unhappy man to solve<br />
Our cruel daughter's riddles? Though I scarce<br />
Can hope....<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
As far as the sacrifices are concerned, Heaven<br />
knows, your Majesty may be quite easy on that<br />
point. There has been no economy with regard<br />
to the sacrifices, your Majesty. I have ordered<br />
sacrifices to be made to High Heaven of one<br />
hundred dogs, sacrifice of one hundred horses to<br />
the Sun, and of one hundred cats to the Moon.<br />
(<i>Aside.</i>) I, for my own part, Heaven knows,<br />
expect nothing from this Imperial butchery except<br />
sausages and meat-pies.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TARTAGLIA.</span><br />
<br />
(<i>Aside.</i>) It would have been far better to<br />
slaughter that cat of a Princess. Then everything<br />
would be in order. That would be the best<br />
way to end all this spitting and scratching.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALTOUM.</span><br />
<br />
Let the new-comer be conducted hither!<br />
<br />
(<i>Exit one of the</i> DOCTORS.)<br />
<br />
I will endeavour to dissuade him. You,<br />
My reverend doctors, help in this, and you,<br />
My faithful ministers and counsellors,<br />
If, haply, grief should paralyse my tongue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
We've done our best in that direction often<br />
enough already, your Majesty, and we're getting<br />
about sick of it, Heaven knows. We shall talk<br />
at him till our throats are sore, and then he'll<br />
go and get his windpipe cut like a turkey.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TARTAGLIA.</span><br />
<br />
Listen here, Pantalone. If my observations can<br />
be relied on, this young Prince has gifts of the<br />
very highest order, and a degree of ingenuity<br />
which is positively penetrating. I do not quite<br />
give up all hope.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
Rot, my dear fellow, rot! You think he's going,<br />
to guess that snake's riddles. Rot! Stuff and<br />
nonsense! Humbug! Get out! He's done for.<br />

<br />
Arise, thou young and madly daring man!<br />
<br />
(CALAF <i>rises, makes an obeisance, and stands<br />
with noble bearing between the two<br />
thrones, facing the spectators.</i> ALTOUM<br />
<i>scans him carefully</i>. <i>Aside.</i>)<br />
<br />
How handsome the youth is! Compassion moves<br />
My breast.<br />
<br />
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Unhappy man, what is thy name?<br />
What King calls himself father unto thee?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF</span> (<i>at first somewhat confused, then with a<br />
noble bow</i>).<br />
<br />
Sire, let me beg a boon: that for the nonce<br />
My name be covered up with dark.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALTOUM.</span><br />
<br />
How now!<br />
<br />
You woo the Emperor's daughter, and withhold<br />
Your name?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF</span> (<i>with pride</i>).<br />
<br />
I am of royal blood. If Heaven<br />
Decree my death, there will be time left then<br />
To make my name and country known to you.<br />
<br />
(<i>With another bow.</i>)<br />
<br />
Vouchsafe me silence for the present, Sire.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALTOUM</span> (<i>aside</i>).<br />
<br />
What noble speech and port!<br />
(<i>Aloud.</i>) But if perchance<br />
You solve the riddles, and then prove to be<br />
Of mean extraction, how shall the edict...<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF</span> (<i>interrupting him quickly</i>).<br />
<br />
Sire,<br />
The edict serves not save for sons of Kings.<br />
If I by help of Heaven should solve the riddles,<br />
And then were found to be of base extraction,<br />
Let my head pay for it. My body give<br />
To dogs and carrion crows upon the fields.<br />
There is one man in Pekin knows my name,<br />
And he will bear me witness.<br />
<br />
(<i>With an obeisance to the</i> EMPEROR.)<br />
<br />
Therefore I<br />
Entreat you in your mercy once again,<br />
Still let my name be covered up with dark.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALTOUM.</span><br />
<br />
So be it then! It is your pleasing speech<br />
And noble bearing make me grant the boon.<br />
Oh that you now would grant the Emperor<br />
The boon he begs for from his very throne,<br />
Beseeching you: Go back, my son, go back!<br />
Desist from this adventure, and go back!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
We can't get him any farther, your Majesty.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALTOUM.</span><br />
<br />
The nations are already nursing wrath<br />
Against me for the reckless oath I swore.<br />
Do not thou also force me to shed tears<br />
Over thy corpse. Oh, force me not to hate<br />
This daughter of my loins more than I do<br />
Already; force me not to hate myself<br />
Who brought her into the world, more than I do.<br />
Proud, vain, and pitiless, and cruel, source<br />
Is she of torment to me till I die.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Sire, but I cannot think that you have cause<br />
To fill your heart with torment and unrest.<br />
If in your daughter there is cruelty,<br />
It is not from her father that it came.<br />
If guilt you have, it can be only this:<br />
That you have given the world such peerless beauty<br />
As draws all men to her. I thank you, Sire,<br />
For your great goodness! I have but one thought,<br />
To win your Turandot or live no more.<br />
All that I ask is death or Turandot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
H'm, my dearest Royal Highness, I presume<br />
you vouchsafed to behold the severed heads on<br />
the city wall. Eh? Heaven knows what pleasure<br />
there can be in having oneself stuck like a pig,<br />
so that afterwards the whole town is full of<br />
tears and blowing of noses, Heaven knows. I<br />
can tell you beforehand, the Princess will nail<br />
you three riddles together that it would take<br />
Old Moore himself seven years to take to pieces,<br />
Heaven knows. We two sit here, year in, year<br />
out, and the learned doctors, too, sit here in<br />
judgment, judging who guesses well and who<br />
guesses ill, and we've had a bit of practice and<br />
we can "read print, Heaven knows&mdash;and yet we<br />
can't make head or tail of our most wise Princess's<br />
riddles. These are not riddles like those in<br />
Saturday's <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, such as:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Puts his head between his feet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And rolls him in a ball complete,"</span><br />
<br />
or:<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Four already, I'll be bound,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This is one when it is found."</span><br />
<br />
No, these are confounded new-fangled puzzles<br />
with man-traps in 'em and patent springs. And<br />
if she didn't write the solutions beforehand on<br />
slips of paper and pop 'em into sealed envelopes<br />
and hand 'em in to the doctors, why even they<br />
wouldn't know whether they were standing on their<br />
head or their feet, Heaven knows. You go back<br />
home, my dearest Royal Highness. It really<br />
would be a pity, such a fine young fellow as you<br />
are. Do as I advise you, Heaven knows. If<br />
you don't I wouldn't give as much for your head<br />
as I would for a turnip radish. No use, no use.<br />

You talk and lose your breath, old gentleman,<br />
What I demand is death or Turandot.<br />

<span class="name">TARTAGLIA.</span><br />
<br />
Turandot.... Turandot.... What a<br />
damned stupid ass the dear fellow is! You just<br />
listen to me, my dear boy! This is not a<br />
question of drawing lots with blades of straw<br />
for a cup of coffee or an iced chocolate. Get<br />
that into your head; do be quick and get that<br />
into your head, please. It is a question here of<br />
keeping or losing your head. That is the only<br />
argument I will bring forward to reduce you to<br />
reason. This one argument <i>should</i> suffice. Your<br />
head is in danger, do you understand? Your<br />
head. His belovÃ¨d Majesty in his own most<br />
gracious person begs and implores you not, to<br />
lose your head. His Imperial Majesty has in<br />
his own most gracious person sacrificed one hundred<br />
horses to the Sun, one hundred dogs to High<br />
Heaven, and one hundred cats to the Moon, to<br />
induce them to restore your lost wits&mdash;and you,<br />
you sweet little sugar-plum you, you actually<br />
refuse. Why, even if there were no other fish<br />
in the sea except Princess Turandot, your intentions<br />
would still amount to capital folly. You<br />
must give me credit, my dearest Prince, for talking<br />
so frankly, because I wish you well. Have you,<br />
may I ask, at any time carefully considered what<br />
it means to be shortened by a head? I can hardly<br />
believe you have.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />

You talk too much and lose your breath, dear sir.<br />
Death is what I demand or Turandot.<br />

<br />
Death have then, and with death my own despair.<br />

Forces the closed arms of his sullen fate.<br />

Why should I not be free to fight my foe?<br />
What brings you here to harden me again?<br />
If prayers can move you, I myself will beg:<br />
Desist! Put not my sharp mind to the test.<br />
It is my only pride, the only weapon<br />

Torture me not. That is the very reason...<br />
I am ashamed to say that it is so....<br />
But there are other feelings strange to me....<br />
I seem to shiver both with heat and frost....<br />
No, no, I hate him, I am sure, Zelima&mdash;<br />
Hate him for making me a laughing-stock<br />
Before the whole Divan&mdash;nay, the whole world!<br />
How they will laugh at me! Help me, Zelima!<br />
Come to my help! How did his riddle run:<br />
"Who is that Prince and of what stock is he,<br />
Who was a beggar, porter, menial,<br />
Yet in good fortune more unfortunate?"<br />
So much is clear that he himself is meant.<br />
But how in all the world am I to guess<br />
His and his father's names? Here no one knows him.<br />
The Emperor himself has granted him<br />
For the time being still to be unknown.<br />
Only to save time did I take the odds.<br />

Enough of this&mdash;enough!<br />
I said, indeed... my heart... believe it not.<br />

They all are treacherous: pretending love<br />
Until they have the maiden in their toils;<br />
But when they have their will, they laugh at us,<br />
Dallying with now this woman and now that;<br />
Nor is there any slave too base for them,<br />
Nor any harlot at too low a price.<br />
Zelima, speak no more of him. If he<br />
To-morrow is victorious again,<br />
Oh, I shall hate him worse than death.<br />

Dear mistress,<br />
So long as you are young and beautiful,<br />
Rebellion beseems you. But when age<br />
Comes creeping on, and wooers stay away,<br />

<br />
(<i>Has slowly come nearer, and now interrupts her.</i>)<br />
<br />
They that are base<br />
In birth may, it is true, so basely think<br />
As thou, Zelima. How couldst thou conceive<br />
The feelings of our noble mistress, when<br />
After so many years with triumph crowned,<br />
A stranger roving here from who knows where<br />
Puts her to shame in public? How shouldst thou<br />
Know anything of pride and pain and shame?<br />
Thou didst not see the looks of mockery,<br />
The slanted smile round every mouth. I saw it,<br />
Saw it and shook with rage and shame for her.<br />
I love her. And shall I stand and see her now,<br />
Against the promptings of her heart and will,<br />
Delivered up into a stranger's hands?<br />

<br />
Be silent, thou! Thou pretty little slave,<br />
Thou hast no need to understand these things.<br />
What matters it to thee if, heedlessly,<br />
She pledged her word? And what shall come to pass<br />
In the Divan to-morrow if in shame<br />
She hold her tongue? I can already see<br />
The mockery scarcely hid, the open scorn,<br />
And the base wit, such wit as is the meed<br />
Of a poor actress.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TURANDOT</span> (<i>beside herself</i>).<br />

Hold your tongue, Adelma!<br />

Oh, find the names,<br />
Dear, wise Adelma....<br />

Adelma. His name, and his father's name.<br />
How shall I find them out? Adelma, help me!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
One thing I know: to-day in the Divan<br />
Himself betrayed it: in this city lives<br />
<i>One</i> man who knows his name and origin.<br />
Now what behoves us is to ferret through<br />
The town, and if we make no stint of gold<br />
Haply we may discover what we seek.<br />
<br />

Take anything&mdash;gold, gems&mdash;do what you will.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
What can she do with gold or precious stones?<br />
Whom shall she give them to, to purchase help?<br />
And if the plan succeed, what will you do<br />
If some one find your mesh of trickery?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
Who would betray the trick&mdash;if not Zelima?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ZELIMA</span> (<i>flaring up</i>).<br />
<br />
Shame on your venomous tongue! Princess, hear <i>me</i>:<br />
Cast not your gold away. I had indeed<br />
Hoped to appease, convince you in the end,<br />
Hoped you would give the Prince your hand&mdash;the Prince<br />
Who loves you, and well is worthy of your love.<br />
Now I will be obedient. My old mother,<br />
Skirina, came to visit me just now.<br />
Rejoicing at the fortune of the Prince,<br />
And knowing nothing of the imminent<br />
Encounter which to-morrow shall decide,<br />
She told me she had spoken to the stranger<br />
The night before, and said that my step-father,<br />
Old Hassan, knows him. There and then I asked<br />
What might his name be, but she did not know,<br />
Or swore she did not. Hassan, so she said,<br />
Would not betray his name for any price.<br />
This notwithstanding, she has promised me<br />
To do her best to worm the secret out.<br />
Now, Princess, doubt my zeal, if still you can.<br />
<br />
(<i>Exit in excitement.</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TURANDOT.</span><br />
<br />
Come, to my arms! Why does she run away?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
Let the fool go. Now we have got the scent,<br />
And let us with swift cunning track the game.<br />
But come with me straightway and let me tell you<br />
The plan I have. Put all your trust in me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TURANDOT.</span><br />
<br />
Adelma, I put all my trust in you.<br />
But save me from this stranger whom I loathe.<br />

screw loose under your turban. Your conduct<br />
so far had led me, I trust not misled me, to<br />

'Sh! 'Sh! It's no use crying over spilt milk.<br />
Heaven knows, my dear Prince, you little suspect<br />
what hot water you've got into, and if we hadn't<br />
kept a sharp eye on you, you'd be in a fine<br />
pickle at this moment. (<i>To</i> BARAK.) Your<br />
presence here, Mr. Nanny-goat, is no longer<br />
desired! As for you, my dearest Royal Highness,<br />
will you have the goodness to withdraw to<br />
your private apartments? Brigella, you will<br />
forthwith call two thousand men of the guards to<br />
arms, and with your corps of pages sentinel the<br />
entrance to his suite, taking care that no one<br />
gains admission. Our most Sublime Majesty,<br />
the Emperor, is so much in love with the Prince<br />
that he is all the time in a perfect state lest<br />
anything should happen to him. If he is not his<br />
son-in-law by to-morrow morning, Heaven knows<br />
the old gentleman will succumb to this violent<br />
passion. (<i>To</i> CALAF.) And let me tell you,<br />
you've been making a fool of yourself. (<i>Whispering<br />
to him.</i>) For Heaven's sake, don't let your<br />
name get between your teeth! But if by any<br />

in good keeping. What do you say?<br />

You seek, and know it not.<br />

Until to-morrow night. Your unknown suitor<br />

You will not, cannot guess the names. My child,<br />

Why will you once again, this day that dawns,<br />
Have yourself put to shame before a crowd,<br />
Suffering the cruel malice of their hate?<br />

That he shall quit my lands without delay,<br />

I have them here&mdash;and I will tell you them.<br />
To-morrow then you may in the Divan<br />
Put him to shame and contumely, and see<br />
His anguish and his torture call for death,<br />
Because with you he loses all he loved.<br />
And only one thing do I crave: when you<br />
Have fed your vengeance on him to the full,<br />
Reach him your hand and be his willing wife.<br />
Swear it; we are alone. Then have the names.<br />
And all shall be a secret, mine and yours.<br />

What shall I do? Depend upon Adelma?<br />
Or shall I let my father tell the names,<br />
And bow my head to the yoke?... Less is the shame,<br />
Beyond all doubt, to yield to one's own father.<br />
But what if wise Adelma had succeeded<br />
Already, and my oath had been too soon?<br />

No, I will wait for Adelma.<br />

To talk me over.<br />

<br />
My Prince, I am a slave of Turandot,<br />
And hither come by ways which even to her<br />
Are closed. Good news I bring you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Slave, you lie.<br />
The heart of Turandot is pitiless.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ZELIMA.</span><br />
<br />
You speak the truth. And yet: you are the first<br />
That ever touched it. You believe me not,<br />
And yet it is quite true. She says she hates you,<br />
And she already loves you. May the earth<br />
Swallow me if it is not true she loves you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
The news <i>is</i> good. I will believe. What next?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ZELIMA.</span><br />
<br />
She bids me tell you, only her ambition<br />
Drives her to desperation. Now she sees<br />
That what she undertook she cannot do,<br />
But thinking of to-morrow and its shame<br />
She is consumed.... May the earth swallow me,<br />
If here I lie!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Enough, my pretty slave.<br />
I will believe. Go! Tell her: it is easy<br />
To give the contest up. And she would win<br />
Fairer renown by softening her heart,<br />
And giving of her own free will the hand<br />
He longs for to the man who loves her true.<br />
Is this the message, haply, that you bring?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ZELIMA.</span><br />
<br />
No, Prince. My message runs not so. We ask<br />
Consideration for our weaknesses.<br />
The Princess begs you for a favour. Spare<br />
Her vanity. Help her to say those names<br />
In the Divan to-morrow. Then she herself<br />
Will from her throne descend, and reach to you<br />
Her right hand. You it costs so little. Say<br />
The names, and in this manner win her heart.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF</span> (<i>with a smile</i>).<br />
<br />
H'm! Pretty slave, where is the speech's end?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ZELIMA.</span><br />
<br />
What speech's end, your Highness?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
"Let the earth<br />
Swallow me if I lie in this."<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ZELIMA.</span><br />
<br />
You doubt it?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
I do a little doubt it&mdash;just so much<br />
That I refuse to do what you desire.<br />
Go, tell your mistress, if I hide the names<br />
It is because a lover must be cautious&mdash;<br />
I do not hide them with intent to pain her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ZELIMA</span> (<i>violently</i>).<br />
<br />
Fool, fool! you little know what this will cost you!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
And if it cost my life!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ZELIMA.</span><br />
<br />
You soon will see.<br />
Good-night.<br />
<br />
(<i>Aside.</i>)<br />
<br />
The fool! He has made a fool of me.<br />
<br />
(<i>Exit in a rage.</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Be steadfast, heart! Only a few hours more<br />
The skies will clear, and fear will have an end.<br />
That I could sleep.... My tortured spirit yearns<br />
For rest. Sink down upon me, gentle sleep!<br />
<br />
(<i>Goes to sleep.</i>)<br />

<br />
(<i>Comes creeping in cautiously from right,<br />
creeps under the divan.</i>)<br />
<br />
Well, thank God! he's gone to sleep at last.<br />
'Sh! 'Sh! (<i>In the front of the stage before<br />
the footlights.</i>) As my poor old mother used to<br />
say, "A good name is worth a fortune." What<br />
a good name this idiot of a Prince must have,<br />
considering how my gracious Princess is throwing<br />
all her money away on him! Skirina's got some,<br />
Zelima's got some, Brigella's got some. I've got<br />
some, and I'm going to get two purses extra if<br />
I get this young hopeful's name. And I shall<br />
get it! You watch me. I'm going to! (<i>With<br />
much ceremony he pulls a big turnip, wrapped<br />
in a strip of paper, out of his dress.</i>) Here I<br />
have the famous magic root mandragora. The<br />
Universal Doctor and Great Herbalist Pimpernel,<br />
Market Square, second door to the right, let me<br />
have it for a tanner. Warranted, of course.<br />
Warranted to go two years. Printed instructions<br />
for use attached. (<i>Unwraps the turnip, reads:</i>)<br />
"The root mandragora opens all doors, bursts all<br />
locks, raises hidden treasure, confers riches and<br />
wisdom...." (<i>Looks up.</i>) Aha! just what<br />
I want. (<i>Reads on:</i>) "It has influence over<br />
the constellations and the planets, makes the blind<br />
to see and the deaf to hear, is a protection<br />
against the evil eye, heals all maladies of the<br />
mind, depression in men and melancholy in<br />
women...." (<i>Looks up.</i>) Aha! Depression,<br />
quite so. Melancholy, quite so. (<i>Reads on:</i>) "It<br />
confers the gift of second sight, reveals hidden<br />
secrets...." (<i>Looks up.</i>) Ah! now we have<br />
it. Hidden secrets.... "Let it be placed under<br />
the pillow of the person, whether male or female,<br />
whose secret it is desired to know, when the<br />
said person is asleep. Then the person aforesaid..."<br />
Hurrah! (<i>jumps for joy</i>) "will,<br />
by dreaming aloud, communicate what it is desired<br />
to know." Did you hear that? Isn't that the<br />
very thing? (<i>Creeps up to</i> CALAF'S <i>bed, and,<br />
with excessive caution, places the turnip under<br />
his pillow</i>.) 'Sh! 'Sh!<br />
<br />
(<i>Draws back a little, and waits, in the<br />
greatest excitement, for what is going<br />
to happen.</i> CALAF <i>does not utter a<br />
sound</i>. <i>With a disappointed face</i><br />
TRUFFALDINO <i>creeps nearer the bed<br />
again</i>. CALAF <i>remains dumb</i>.)<br />
<br />
Do say something, my dear boy! Do say something,<br />
please! (<i>Waits a little.</i>) Out with the<br />
name, my sweet little lambkin.<br />
<br />
(<i>With transfigured face</i> CALAF <i>whispers<br />
terms of endearment</i>.)<br />
<br />
What's he saying now? Tu... Tu...<br />
Turandot. Oh, bother! I know that name<br />
already, the name of my adored Princess. It's<br />
<i>your</i> name I want to know, my darling boy.<br />
<br />
(CALAF <i>goes on whispering excitedly</i>. <i>He<br />
smiles in his happy dream, and raises<br />
himself on his elbow during the following<br />
without opening his eyes</i>.)<br />
<br />
Tu... nothing but Turandot! Well, then, here<br />
I am, duckie. Here I am, lovey, here I am&mdash;my<br />
own very self, your own little lovey duckie<br />
Turandot. (<i>Purses up his lips.</i> CALAF <i>smiles<br />
as though in rapture</i>.) What wouldst thou<br />
have of me, my sweetest heart? Eh? Well,<br />
what? Something like this? (<i>Smacks his lips.</i>)<br />
Well, then, you <i>shall</i> have it, and more besides.<br />
But first of all, darling, you must tell me your<br />
name, your own delightful, sweet little name, my<br />
honey!...<br />
<br />
(CALAF <i>sinks back and lies dumb again,<br />
sulkily</i>.)<br />
<br />
Oh, you won't, won't you? You really won't?<br />
How nasty of you, my love! Just look at me.<br />
See how pretty I am! (<i>Trips coquettishly up<br />
and down in front of the bed.</i>) Look at my<br />
lovely white arms and my lovely plump legs,<br />
and my glorious hair hanging all down my back!<br />
...Just look at it, my sweet little chick!<br />
<br />
(CALAF <i>begins to whisper excitedly, raising<br />
himself the while</i>.)<br />
<br />
That's right, that's right, quite so: talk, talk,<br />
my bonny babe! (<i>Bends down again, till his<br />
mouth almost touches the sleeper's.</i>) Once again,<br />
my sweet one! Say it once again, my little white<br />
lambkin! It shall have its kiss, it shall, right<br />
away.<br />
</p>

<p>(CALAF <i>turns suddenly and violently round
on the other side, and deals him a ringing
box on the ear</i>. (<i>Squeaking noisily</i>,
TRUFFALDINO <i>runs away</i>. CALAF <i>sits
up for a moment in astonishment, opens
his eyes, shuts them again immediately,
and sinks back on his couch</i>.)</p>

O moment I have sighed for long! O love,<br />
That lendest cunning courage unto me!<br />
And Fortune, thou that through all obstacles<br />
Hast led me hither: help a lovesick maid!<br />
Oh, bring me to the goal of my desires!<br />
Silence this yearning, love! And, Fortune, break<br />
These galling fetters....<br />
<br />
(<i>She lets the light of her lantern rest on</i><br />
CALAF, <i>and gazes at him</i>.)<br />
<br />
My belovÃ¨d sleeps.<br />
Oh, burst not, heart! Dear eyes, how loth I am<br />
To trespass on the rest possessing you!<br />
And yet I must. At once. The short night flees.<br />
<br />
(<i>She puts her lantern down.</i>)<br />
<br />
Stranger, awake!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF</span> (<i>starts up in a fright</i>).<br />

Whose voice awakens me?<br />
What seekest thou again, thou creeping ghost?<br />
Why are my eyes denied their sleep?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
Be calm!<br />
Only a wretched woman stands before you.<br />
And she does not come, as the other did,<br />
To lure the names from you by trickery.<br />
<br />
<br />

Let be! You cannot cheat me.<br />

(<i>Puts her lantern down.</i>)<br />

<br />
Yes, and she went as wise, as when she came,<br />
And you will go as wise as when you came.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
You know me ill to be so rude. Sit up<br />
And listen.<br />
<br />
(<i>Sits down on the divan.</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Well, then, what is your desire?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
First look at me, and then.... Prince, tell me now,<br />
Who do you think I am?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
In shape and bearing<br />
Noble you seem, but by your dress a slave.<br />
And as a slave I saw you yesterday<br />
In the Divan.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
Five years since I saw you,<br />
And then <i>you</i> were a slave.<br />
<br />
(<i>Raises her veil.</i>)<br />
<br />
Look at this face!<br />
Do you not know it?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Adelma! How! Adelma,<br />
Whom I thought dead!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
She is a serving-maid,<br />
Who was the daughter of King Kaikobad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Adelma! A slave!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
A slave! I'll tell you why.<br />
I had a brother, blind with love, as you are,<br />
For Turandot. In the Divan he met her.<br />
<br />
(<i>Weeps.</i>)<br />
<br />
You saw his head above the city gate<br />
With all the others.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
It is true, then, true.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
My father Kaikobad, in fury bold,<br />
Led his array against Altoum. Fortune,<br />
The fickle jade, lured him to his defeat<br />
And death. Altoum's general devised<br />
At one fell stroke to extirpate our race.<br />
My brothers he assassinated. Me,<br />
Together with my mother and three sisters,<br />
He cast into the river, then in spate.<br />
The gentle Emperor, coming on the scene,<br />
Ordered his guards to fish us out again.<br />
I was the only one brought to the shore,<br />
And I was led in the triumphal train,<br />
And given as a slave to Turandot,<br />
To wait on the hard-hearted woman who<br />
Was cause of all my griefs. Now, Calaf, speak,<br />
Am I not worth compassion?<br />
<br />
(<i>Weeps.</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF</span> (<i>moved</i>).<br />
<br />
Indeed you are,<br />
Adelma, Princess of the Carcasenes!<br />
But what can so unfortunate a man<br />
As I am do for you? If fortune smile<br />
On me to-morrow, I will promise help<br />
For you, and freedom. And your grieving now<br />
Can only heap the measure of my own.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
You know me now, my destiny, my race.<br />
May you the better credit a King's daughter,<br />
What pity&mdash;I will not say love&mdash;constrains her<br />
Now to confide to you. False Turandot,<br />
Malicious, cunning, cruel Turandot,<br />
Soon as the morning dawns, will have you murdered.<br />
All orders are already given. So much<br />
From her, who is the mistress of your dreams.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF</span> (<i>starts up savagely</i>).<br />
<br />
She will have me murdered, do you say?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
(<i>Rises likewise, with the most solemn emphasis.</i>)<br />
<br />
Yes, murdered:<br />
While you are on your way to the Divan.<br />
A score of swords await your setting out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF</span> (<i>beside himself</i>).<br />
<br />
I will call the guards.<br />
<br />
(<i>Makes for the door.</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA</span> (<i>holds him back</i>).<br />
<br />
Bethink yourself, rash man!<br />
The guards? They have been bought by Turandot!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF</span> (<i>in blind despair</i>).<br />
<br />
Timur, my wretched father, thus it stands.<br />
With Calaf, thy proud son; he that set out<br />
To seek good fortune for himself and thee!<br />
<br />
(<i>Covers his face with his hands.</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA</span> (<i>aside</i>).<br />
<br />
Haha! Timur... Calaf.... Be thrice blest, lie<br />
That lured this forth. Doubly I hold him now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Can it be possible that Turandot...<br />
How <i>can</i> it be that such an angel's face<br />
Should hide such devilry?...<br />
<br />
(<i>Contemptuously.</i>)<br />
<br />
No. You deceive me,<br />
Adelma. Go!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
I will forgive your doubt.<br />
An angel's face? Oh, would that you had seen her<br />
As I have! In the harem rages she,<br />
And like a snapping bitch runs to and fro,<br />
Green in the face, and with her bloodshot eyes<br />
Shining with hate under distorted brows.<br />
Doubt if you will. That you should doubt my words<br />
Is not such pain as your approaching death.<br />
<br />
(<i>Weeps.</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
What treachery! By the very guards betrayed<br />
Appointed to protect me! He spake right,<br />
That rascal of a captain: Gold kills duty.<br />
Life, fare thee well!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
And yet you may escape<br />
Your evil star. Up, I will show the way.<br />
By saving you from death, I save myself<br />
From slavery. With my jewels I have bought<br />
Two of the guards, an escort I have hired,<br />
And horses are in readiness. The Khan<br />
Of Berlas is my kinsman. Leagued with him<br />
Let us invade and seize my kingdom&mdash;yours,<br />
If so you will. And this my hand be yours,<br />
If you will have it. But if you will not,<br />
The Tartar Kings are not unblest with daughters,<br />
Fair maidens full of love and fit for you.<br />
Be you the King, and I will be your subject.<br />
Only flee, death. Only deliver me.<br />
And I will conquer even my love, which now,<br />
Crimson with shame, I have confessed.....<br />
Day dawns!<br />
Day dawns! My head swims.... Stranger, flee with me!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
In vain. I have resolved to stay and die.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
Then I will, too, stay for a little while<br />
In slavery yet. And soon it will be seen<br />
Which of us two is readier to die.<br />
<br />
(<i>Aside.</i>)<br />
<br />
Often persistent love attains at last!<br />
Calaf, Timur's son?<br />
<br />
(<i>Aloud.</i>)<br />
<br />
Stranger Prince, good-night!<br />
<br />
(<i>Exit.</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Oh, will this night of horrors never end?<br />
And this fight of the soul that is consumed<br />
In burning love? By Fortune cast away&mdash;<br />
Cast into perils, by her hate pursued,<br />
I tarry for the dawn and traitorous knives.<br />
<br />
(<i>The scene grows light.</i>)<br />
<br />
See, the sun rises. Now the hour is come<br />
For her to feed her pleasure on my blood,<br />
The hour has come that sees my torment end!<br />

ALTOUM, PANTALONE, TARTAGLIA, <i>the</i> DOCTORS,

<br />
How's this? No trace of ambushed murderers?<br />
Did the slave lie? Can Turandot have found<br />
The names out, and rescinded her commands?<br />
Then I lose all. Death had been better far.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALTOUM.</span><br />
<br />
My son, you seem excited and in fear,<br />
And I were fain had you a merry face.<br />
Now all is well. Your sorrows are at end.<br />
Glad tidings that concern you I will save<br />
A little while. As for my daughter, she<br />
Is yours. She sent to me thrice in the night<br />
Petitioning release from this encounter.<br />
Therefore I charge you, son, be of good cheer!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
Heaven knows, my dearest Royal Highness, I<br />
myself had to trot off in the night to pay a call<br />
on her Royal Highness in the Seraglio and receive<br />
her most illustrious commands. I didn't even<br />
have the time to tumble into my slippers and<br />
get dressed properly. And it was so cold,<br />
Heaven knows (<i>coughs</i>), I'm shivering yet. Never<br />
mind! Never mind!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TARTAGLIA.</span><br />
<br />
They fetched me out of bed at 5 a.m. It was<br />
just beginning to get light a bit. She made<br />
me stand in front of her half an hour while she<br />
went on whining something or other. For sheer<br />
cold and vexation I talked the most clotted<br />
nonsense to her. (<i>Aside.</i>) It would have suited<br />
my humour better if I could have given her a<br />
downright good spanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALTOUM.</span><br />
<br />
You see yourself: she is so slow in coming.<br />
I have already sent explicit orders<br />
In case of need to bring her here by force.<br />
Here she shall stand and learn to blush, a pain<br />
She would not let me spare her. Therefore, son,<br />
Take good heart at the prospect of near joy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
I crave your pardon, sire, and give you thanks!<br />
I am tormented by most fearful doubts,<br />
And by the thought that for my sake she now<br />
Is suffering shame and force. Much rather... No<br />
Not that. If I <i>do</i> lose her, what remains<br />
To me of life? With time and tenderness<br />
I will compel her to forget this rage.<br />
My will shall be her wish, my heart her heart.<br />
For her sake I will grant what either asks,<br />
And my love's banner be: Fidelity!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALTOUM.</span><br />
<br />
Let there be no more dallying! This Divan<br />
Be changed into a temple, so that she,<br />
Soon as she enters here, may recognize<br />
That I too have a will. Prepare the marriage.<br />

The accompaniment does at all events sound<br />
decidedly dismal. That's what I call a genuine<br />
wedding march, just the same as for a funeral.<br />

<h3><a name="SCENE_IIb" id="SCENE_IIb"></a>SCENE II</h3>

<p>TURANDOT, ADELMA, ZELIMA, TRUFFALDINO,
EUNUCHS, SLAVES. <i>The foregoing.</i>
(<i>To the strains of a gloomy march</i> TURANDOT
<i>appears</i>. <i>Before her proceed eunuchs.</i>
<i>Her whole escort wear signs of mourning.</i>
<i>With the same ceremonial as in
First Act</i>, TURANDOT <i>ascends the
throne, and at sight of the altar and
the priests starts with surprise</i>. <i>The
position of the actors is exactly the same
as in the First Act.</i> CALAF <i>stands
erect in the centre</i>.)</p>


<p class="drama">

<br />
This mourning of my escort, <i>Prince unknown</i>,<br />
These gloomy faces and these necks bowed down,<br />
Are (well I know it) sweet to your hard heart;<br />
And, mourning, I behold the altar ready.<br />
For all my efforts to avenge the shame<br />
Put on me yesterday, I still am helpless.<br />
I have fought my fight. I bow my neck to fate.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Would you could read the heart you say is hard,<br />
Princess, to see what wormwood your hate blends<br />
With all its rapture. Let not your heart rue<br />
Crowning the man with happiness who loves you<br />
And worships you, and if it is a crime<br />
To worship you, I beg you here: forgive!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALTOUM.</span><br />
<br />
Enough. She is not worth such humble words.<br />
Now teach <i>her</i> to be humble! Music, ho!<br />
Up! To the altar! Let the priests begin!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TURANDOT.</span><br />
<br />
One moment more! What vengeance is so sweet<br />
As this: to cradle in security<br />
And restfulness an unsuspecting heart,<br />
And then from the pinnacle of happiness<br />
To dash it down into the blackest hell<br />
Of torment?<br />
<br />
(<i>She rises.</i>)<br />
<br />
Hear me, all of you: Depart<br />
From this Divan, <i>Calaf, son of Timur</i>!<br />
There is the riddle solved you set me. Wretch,<br />
Go! seek another wife, and shake with fear<br />
Of Turandot, whom none can overcome.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF</span> (<i>confounded and stricken</i>).<br />
<br />
Great Heaven! Lost! Lost!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
What do I hear? Great Heaven!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
Holy Madonna, she's gone and done it in his<br />
beard, my dear Lord Chancellor, Heaven knows.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TARTAGLIA.</span><br />
<br />
(<i>Mopping his face.</i>) Holy Gorgonzola! this<br />
gets over me and no mistake.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Lost! No one helps me. Who <i>could</i> help me now?<br />
I have-been my own assassin, and in the end<br />
I lose by too much loving love itself.<br />
Why did I solve the riddles yesterday?<br />
If I had failed to solve them, I were now<br />
Cold, dumb, and free from torture worse than death.<br />
Great-hearted Emperor, why do you not<br />
Let that grim law hold good another time?<br />
Now she has found the names, give your cold daughter,<br />
To be her crowning triumph, this last head.<br />
<br />
(<i>Approaches</i> TURANDOT'S <i>throne</i>.)<br />
<br />
Most cruel Princess, does it not offend you<br />
To know the heart still beating that has dared<br />
To love you? Look upon your victim here,<br />
Calaf, hateful to you, hateful to Heaven,<br />
To the world hateful, and to fortune too&mdash;<br />
Calaf, who at your feet now dies.<br />
<br />
(<i>He draws a dagger, and makes a thrust at<br />
his heart</i>. TURANDOT <i>leaps down from<br />

Calaf,<br />
What are you doing?<br />
<br />

<span class="name">ALTOUM.</span><br />
<br />
Dare I trust my eyes?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Leave me alone, cold woman! Let me die!<br />
<br />
(<i>Points the dagger again at his breast.</i><br />
TURANDOT <i>restrains him</i>.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TURANDOT.</span><br />
<br />
Stay! You shall live! and you shall live for me!<br />
Listen!<br />
<br />
(<i>To</i> ZELIMA.)<br />
<br />
Run to the prisoners, Zelima!<br />
Comfort old faithful Barak and your mother!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ZELIMA.</span><br />
<br />
Mistress, I will, and lose no time.<br />
<br />
(<i>Exit.</i>)<br />

<br />
This moment<br />
Spells death for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TURANDOT.</span><br />
<br />
Now hear me: I have won<br />
By accident. For in a sudden burst<br />
Of feeling you betrayed yourself last night<br />
To my quick-witted slave Adelma here.<br />
But let the whole world know: I am above<br />
Injustice. And know you: your chivalrous<br />
Demeanour and fair features have o'ercome<br />
This stubborn heart. Live then, live and be proud:<br />
I am your prize.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA</span> (<i>in pain, aside</i>).<br />
<br />
Oh, torment worse than death....<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF</span> (<i>casts his dagger to the floor</i>).<br />
<br />
Mine! You! Oh, do not kill me, supreme joy!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALTOUM</span> (<i>descends from his throne</i>).<br />
<br />
Let me embrace thee, daughter. This one hour<br />
Makes good the pain you heaped upon my heart.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">PANTALONE.</span><br />
<br />
Wedding! Wedding! Reverend doctors, your<br />
presence is no longer required here.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TARTAGLIA.</span><br />
<br />
Have the goodness to withdraw to the posterior apartment.<br />
<br />
(<i>Exeunt doctors back of stage.</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA</span> (<i>comes to the front</i>. <i>In the greatest<br />
excitement to</i> CALAF).<br />
<br />
Live! Oh, yes, live! Live with my enemy<br />
In happiness.<br />
<br />
(<i>To</i> TURANDOT.)<br />
<br />
To you, Princess, I say:<br />
I hate you. All I tried to do last night<br />
I did to snatch from you the man I love,<br />
Whom secretly I loved ere he loved you.<br />
Last night I sought to have him flee with me.<br />
He would not. All my arts could lure from him<br />
Were those two names, which I betrayed because<br />
I hated you. I planned you should reject him,<br />
And that I then should have him. All in vain.<br />
There is one last way open to me now.<br />
I, too, am royal, and I am ashamed.<br />
That so long I have suffered servitude.<br />
Take now the last of all the Carcasenes<br />
To crown your triumphing....<br />
<br />
(<i>She picks</i> CALAF'S <i>dagger up from the floor</i>.)<br />
<br />
This steel, which you<br />
Have warded from his breast, shall open me<br />
The way to freedom....<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF</span> (<i>restrains her</i>).<br />
<br />
Stay!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
Off! Let me die.<br />
<br />
(<i>In a voice stifled with tears.</i>)<br />
<br />
Ungrateful wretch!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF</span> (<i>snatches the dagger from her</i>).<br />
<br />
No, for I owe you all.<br />
It was your treachery saved me. You shall not<br />
Call me ungrateful.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TURANDOT.</span><br />
<br />
Are you mad, Adelma,<br />
All of a sudden?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Generous Emperor,<br />
If my petition may in aught avail,<br />
Give her her freedom!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TURANDOT.</span><br />
<br />
I petition, too,<br />
My noble father. I conceive it well,<br />
She never can forgive me her distress;<br />
No, nor believe that I can pardon her.<br />
Give her her freedom.... And if you could grant<br />
Some greater favour, do it for our sake!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALTOUM.</span><br />
<br />
On such a day of gladness be the measure<br />
Of mercy full. I give her not alone<br />
Her freedom but her father's kingdom back.<br />
So let her choose a consort she can love,<br />
And rule the realm with him....<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
To all the weight<br />
Of guilt upon my conscience, to my load<br />
Of love sent back from where it should have lodged,<br />
You add the burden of the greatest mercy.<br />
I cannot yet conceive it. Give me time<br />
To understand the height of my good fortune.<br />
But now I have no answer save these tears....<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Oh that I knew now where to find you, father!<br />
My heart, so full of joy, burns to embrace you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALTOUM.</span><br />
<br />
Calaf, rejoice exceedingly. This empire<br />
You have twice won. Your father, too, has won<br />
His kingdom back. Slain is the Sultan who<br />
Robbed it from him. Until your sire's return<br />
A faithful servant wields the sceptre for him,<br />
And in the meantime sends out messengers<br />
To seek you in all countries. Read this leaf I<br />
It signifies the end of all your grief.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">CALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Ye heavenly gods, you raise and you cast down.<br />
You cast down and make mighty, heavenly gods.<br />
<br />
(<i>All present sob in their emotion.</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TURANDOT.</span><br />
<br />
Now nothing more trouble this wedding-day.<br />
<br />
(<i>Comes meditatively somewhat to the front.</i>)<br />
<br />
Calaf here risks his head to win a wife.<br />
A faithful friend and servant risks his life<br />
To save his Prince. A man wins back a throne<br />
For his lost King, and makes it not his own.<br />
A woman, who made out she loved me, hid<br />
A false heart's treachery. And could I then,<br />
After all this, look down in scorn on men?<br />
No. And may Heaven forgive me all I did<br />
That made me seem a monster in men's sight!<br />
<br />
(<i>Steps quite up to the footlights.</i>)<br />
<br />
Dear gentlemen, I tell you this because<br />
I love you all; and if you are polite<br />
Let my conversion have your loud applause.<br />
